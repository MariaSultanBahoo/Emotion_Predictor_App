Here’s a properly formatted and polished version of your **README.md** for the **Emotion Prediction App** 👇

---

# Emotion Prediction App

This repository contains the code for a simple web application built with **Streamlit** that utilizes a fine-tuned **Hugging Face** model to predict the emotion of text input.

The application is trained on the **[dair-ai/emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion)** dataset and uses the **distilbert-base-uncased** model for text classification. It classifies text into one of six emotions:

* 😢 **Sadness**
* 😀 **Joy**
* ❤️ **Love**
* 😡 **Anger**
* 😨 **Fear**
* 😲 **Surprise**

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Text-based Emotion Prediction** → Input any text and get the predicted emotion.
* **Confidence Score** → See how confident the model is in its prediction.
* **Streamlit Web Interface** → Simple and interactive UI.
* **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration** → Easily expose your local app to the internet.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally or in a cloud environment (like **Google Colab**).

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Python **3.7+**
* Git

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-prediction-app.git
   cd emotion-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Cloudflare Tunnel (for public link)**

   ```bash
   !wget -q -O cloudflared.deb https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
   !dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Expose the app via Cloudflare Tunnel**

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8501
   ```

## 📌 Example

```text
Input: "I just got a new job and I’m so happy!"
Prediction: Joy (Confidence: 0.97)
```

Do you also want me to make a **Google Colab usage section** (so you can run the whole app in Colab with `!pip install`, `streamlit`, and `cloudflared` directly)? That could make it easier for others to try it without local setup.
