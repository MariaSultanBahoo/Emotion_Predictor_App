Emotion Prediction App
This repository contains the code for a simple web application built with Streamlit that utilizes a fine-tuned Hugging Face model to predict the emotion of text input.

The application is based on the dair-ai/emotion dataset and uses the distilbert-base-uncased model for text classification. The model is trained to classify text into one of six emotions: 'sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', and 'surprise'.

Features
Text-based Emotion Prediction: Input any text and get a predicted emotion.
Confidence Score: See the confidence level of the predicted emotion.
Streamlit Web Interface: An easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the model.
Cloudflare Tunnel Integration: Easily expose the local Streamlit app to the internet.
